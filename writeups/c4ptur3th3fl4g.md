### Task 2: Spectograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

1. Download the file

   For this task, the audio file should be opened using a sound/wave analyzer tool (I used audacity). I changed the view from Waveform to Spectogram (as shown in the image) and the secret message appeared.

   ![screenshot_audacity](/room_c4ptur3_th3_fl4g/screenshots/audacity.png?raw=true)

   > Super Secret Message

### Task 3: Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

1. Decode the image to reveal the answer.

   Command: `steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg`

   Using `steghide`, information from the stegofile was extracted the stegofile (empty passphrase) to a text file, which contained the flag.

### Task 4: Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

This task was simple, since the two flags could be found using the `strings` command.

![screenshot_strings](/room_c4ptur3_th3_fl4g/strings.png?raw=true)

1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

   > hackerchat.png

2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
